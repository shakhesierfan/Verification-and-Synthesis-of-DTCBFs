# Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions

This repository provides the code for the **verification algorithm** presented in the paper:

**"Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions"**

The implementation focuses on verifying discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and includes an application to the **cart-pole system**, a widely used benchmark in nonlinear control.
