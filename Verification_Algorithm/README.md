# Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions

This repository provides the code for the **verification algorithm** presented in the paper:

**"Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions"**

The implementation verifies whether a candidate discrete-time control barrier function (DTCBF) is valid, even when the associated control policy is unknown. The approach is demonstrated on the **cart-pole system**/
