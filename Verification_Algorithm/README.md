This repository provides the code for the **verification algorithm** presented in the paper "Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions".

The implementation verifies whether a given candidate DTCBF is valid, when the associated control policy is unknown. The approach is demonstrated on the cart-pole system.
