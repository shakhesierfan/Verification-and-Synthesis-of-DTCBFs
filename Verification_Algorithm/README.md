This repository provides the code for the **verification algorithm** presented in the paper "Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions".

The implementation verifies whether a given candidate DTCBF is valid, when a corresponding control policy is unknown. The approach is demonstrated on the cart-pole system.

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 using Python 3.10 (Anaconda) with the required packages installed (e.g., NumPy, PyInterval, Matplotlib, etc.).
